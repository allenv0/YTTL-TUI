# Requirements Document

## Introduction

YTTL currently fails when downloading captions due to inadequate error handling in the caption download process. The application crashes with a JSONDecodeError when the caption URL returns invalid JSON, empty responses, or HTTP errors. This feature will implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure the application gracefully handles caption download failures and continues processing using local transcription.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user running YTTL, I want the application to handle caption download failures gracefully, so that the tool continues working even when YouTube captions are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the caption URL returns an empty response THEN the system SHALL log a warning and fall back to local transcription
2. WHEN the caption URL returns invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL catch the JSONDecodeError and fall back to local transcription
3. WHEN the caption URL returns an HTTP error status THEN the system SHALL handle the error and fall back to local transcription
4. WHEN network timeouts occur during caption download THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout and fall back to local transcription

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed logging when caption download fails, so that I can understand why the fallback to local transcription occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caption download fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error type and details
2. WHEN falling back to local transcription THEN the system SHALL log an informative message about the fallback
3. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide additional debugging information about the caption download process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the caption download function to be resilient to various failure modes, so that the application doesn't crash unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any exception occurs during caption download THEN the system SHALL catch it and return None
2. WHEN the response content is empty THEN the system SHALL detect this condition and return None
3. WHEN the JSON response is missing expected keys THEN the system SHALL handle the KeyError gracefully
4. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle network-related exceptions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to validate caption responses before processing, so that malformed data doesn't cause crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON response is received THEN the system SHALL validate it contains the 'events' key
2. WHEN processing caption events THEN the system SHALL validate each event has required fields
3. WHEN caption text is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle encoding errors gracefully
4. WHEN caption timing data is invalid THEN the system SHALL skip malformed entries and continue processing
