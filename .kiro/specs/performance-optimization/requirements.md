# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on dramatically improving the processing speed of YTTL (YouTube To Text and LLM) by implementing parallel processing for LLM summary generation and optimizing audio processing chunk sizes. The current sequential processing approach creates significant bottlenecks, especially for longer videos, where processing time scales linearly with video duration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Parallel LLM Summary Generation

**User Story:** As a user processing long videos, I want the summarization to happen in parallel so that I can get results much faster instead of waiting for each segment to be processed sequentially.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video segments for summarization THEN the system SHALL process multiple segments concurrently instead of sequentially
2. WHEN using API-based LLM providers (OpenAI/Groq) THEN the system SHALL support configurable concurrent request limits to respect rate limits
3. WHEN using local LLM providers THEN the system SHALL implement thread-safe processing to avoid model conflicts
4. WHEN processing fails for individual segments THEN the system SHALL retry failed segments without blocking successful ones
5. WHEN all segment summaries are complete THEN the system SHALL generate the consolidated hour summary
6. WHEN parallel processing is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain the same output quality and format as sequential processing
7. WHEN processing a 2-hour video THEN the total processing time SHALL be reduced by at least 50% compared to sequential processing

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Audio Processing Optimization

**User Story:** As a user processing videos of various lengths and types, I want the audio processing to automatically optimize chunk sizes so that transcription is faster and more memory-efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio with local Whisper THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust chunk sizes based on available memory and hardware capabilities
2. WHEN processing audio with API-based Whisper THEN the system SHALL optimize chunk sizes to minimize API calls while staying within size limits
3. WHEN system memory is limited THEN the system SHALL use smaller chunks to prevent out-of-memory errors
4. WHEN hardware acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL use larger chunks to maximize throughput
5. WHEN audio contains long periods of silence THEN the system SHALL detect and skip silent segments to reduce processing time
6. WHEN chunk size optimization is active THEN transcription accuracy SHALL remain equivalent to fixed chunk processing
7. WHEN processing different video types (music, speech, mixed) THEN the system SHALL adapt chunk sizes appropriately

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle network issues and processing failures gracefully so that temporary problems don't cause the entire process to fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caption download fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with configurable maximum attempts
2. WHEN LLM API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry individual segments without affecting other concurrent processing
3. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL increase timeout values progressively for subsequent retries
4. WHEN processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information while continuing with successful segments
5. WHEN partial processing succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate output for completed segments and clearly indicate any failures

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor processing performance and configure optimization settings so that I can tune the system for my specific hardware and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL report timing statistics for each processing phase
2. WHEN parallel processing is used THEN the system SHALL report concurrency metrics and efficiency gains
3. WHEN users want to configure performance THEN the system SHALL provide settings for concurrent limits, chunk sizes, and timeout values
4. WHEN processing different video lengths THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest optimal configuration settings
5. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance logging for troubleshooting
