6. WHEN managing configuration THEN it SHALL use Pydantic for validation and settings management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want better error handling and user feedback, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN processing videos THEN it SHALL show detailed progress information
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN it SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. WHEN models fail to load THEN it SHALL provide fallback options and clear guidance
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN it SHALL validate settings and provide helpful error messages
6. WHEN debugging is needed THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive logging at different levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced features and better output quality, so that the summaries are more useful and the tool is more versatile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN processing videos THEN it SHALL support additional video platforms beyond YouTube
3. WHEN using LLMs THEN it SHALL support the latest models and providers
4. WHEN generating output THEN it SHALL include better formatting and styling
5. WHEN processing content THEN it SHALL support multiple languages for captions
6. WHEN saving results THEN it SHALL implement better file organization and metadata

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern development tooling and practices, so that code quality is maintained and development is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN it SHALL include pre-commit hooks for code quality
2. WHEN testing code THEN it SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. WHEN building packages THEN it SHALL use modern build tools and CI/CD practices
