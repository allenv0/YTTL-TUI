# YouTube Playlist Support Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create playlist URL detection function
  - Implement `is_playlist_url()` function to detect YouTube playlist URLs
  - Add support for various playlist URL formats (playlist?list=, /playlist/, etc.)
  - Write unit tests for URL detection logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement playlist information extraction
  - Create `PlaylistInfo` dataclass to hold playlist metadata
  - Implement `extract_playlist_info()` using yt-dlp's playlist extraction
  - Handle playlist extraction errors and edge cases (empty playlists, private playlists)
  - Add validation for extracted playlist data
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Create folder management utilities
  - Implement `sanitize_folder_name()` to make playlist titles filesystem-safe
  - Create `create_playlist_folder()` to handle folder creation and conflict resolution
  - Add support for handling existing folders and name conflicts
  - Write tests for folder name sanitization edge cases
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement playlist processing pipeline
  - Create `process_playlist()` function to orchestrate playlist processing
  - Implement sequential video processing with error handling
  - Create `PlaylistResult` dataclass to track processing results
  - Add logic to continue processing after individual video failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 5. Enhance progress tracking for playlists
  - Extend existing ProgressHooks to support playlist-level progress
  - Create `PlaylistProgressHooks` class for multi-level progress tracking
  - Implement progress display showing current video and overall playlist progress
  - Add video title and count information to progress display
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Update CLI to handle playlist URLs
  - Modify main CLI function to detect and route playlist URLs
  - Ensure all existing command-line options work with playlists
  - Add playlist-specific output formatting and summary display
  - Maintain backward compatibility for single video processing
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Add robust error handling for playlist extraction failures
  - Implement retry logic for network-related failures
  - Create detailed error logging with video-specific information
  - Add graceful handling of partial playlist failures
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Create playlist processing summary and reporting
  - Implement final summary display showing successful/failed videos
  - Add detailed error reporting for failed videos
  - Create output folder information display
  - Add processing time and statistics reporting
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.3_

- [ ] 9. Write comprehensive tests for playlist functionality
  - Create unit tests for all new playlist functions
  - Add integration tests for end-to-end playlist processing
  - Test error scenarios (network failures, private videos, etc.)
  - Add performance tests for large playlists
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 10. Update documentation and help text
