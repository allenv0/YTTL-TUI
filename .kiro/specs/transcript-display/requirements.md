# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the YouTube video summarization tool by adding the ability to display the full transcript alongside the existing summary. Users will be able to view the complete transcript text that was used to generate the summaries, providing transparency and allowing for detailed reference of the original content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user reviewing a video summary, I want to see the full transcript that was used to generate the summary, so that I can reference the original content and verify the accuracy of the summaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the summary HTML is generated THEN the system SHALL include a dedicated transcript section below the summary
2. WHEN displaying the transcript THEN the system SHALL show all caption segments with their original timestamps
3. WHEN a user views the transcript THEN the system SHALL format it in a readable manner with proper spacing and structure
4. WHEN the transcript is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological order of the original captions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the summary page, I want the transcript section to be clearly separated from the summary, so that I can easily distinguish between the AI-generated summary and the original transcript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML page is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a clear heading for the transcript section
2. WHEN the transcript is shown THEN the system SHALL use visual styling to differentiate it from the summary content
3. WHEN displaying the transcript THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing between the summary and transcript sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading the transcript, I want timestamps to be clickable links that jump to the corresponding video position, so that I can easily navigate to specific parts of the video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying transcript segments THEN the system SHALL format timestamps as clickable links
2. WHEN a timestamp link is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the video at the corresponding time position
3. WHEN generating timestamp links THEN the system SHALL use the same URL generation logic as the summary timestamps
4. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN the system SHALL format them in a consistent and readable format (HH:MM:SS)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with a long video transcript, I want the transcript to be well-organized and not overwhelming, so that I can easily scan through the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying long transcripts THEN the system SHALL group transcript segments in a logical manner
2. WHEN showing transcript text THEN the system SHALL preserve paragraph breaks and natural speech patterns where possible
3. WHEN the transcript contains empty or very short segments THEN the system SHALL filter out or consolidate them for better readability
